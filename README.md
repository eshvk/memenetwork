This is an attempt to try to extract, analyze and visualize memes from blog
data. This is pre-alpha research code (which might break and kill your dog).

Currently the algorithm that we are trying out is based on Kolak and Schilt's
paper ``Generating links by mining quotations``. The data is a collection of
blogs crawled during 08 and 09 available to us in the following format:
<blogID> \t <Date Crawled> \t <Blog>
